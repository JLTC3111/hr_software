# Changes Summary - Time Tracking & Employee Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Summary Metrics Not Pulling from time_entries Table

**Problem**: The 4 metric tabs (Work Days, Leave Days, Overtime, Holiday Overtime) in the Time Tracking component were not showing data because the `time_tracking_summary` table was empty.

**Solution**: 
- Added `calculateSummaryFromRawData()` function in `timeTrackingService.js`
- This function calculates metrics directly from `time_entries`, `leave_requests`, and `overtime_logs` tables
- Modified `getTimeTrackingSummary()` to:
  1. First try to get data from `time_tracking_summary` table
  2. If empty or no data, calculate from raw data
  3. Always returns calculated data as fallback

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Metrics now display correctly even if summary table is empty
- ✅ Real-time calculation from actual time entries
- ✅ No need for manual summary table updates
- ✅ Works for both Time Tracking and Time Clock Entry components

### 2. ✅ Employee Deletion Made Permanent

**Problem**: Deleting an employee only set their status to "Inactive" instead of actually removing them from the database.

**Solution**:
- Updated `deleteEmployee()` in `employeeService.js` to permanently delete from database
- Deletes employee record from `employees` table
- CASCADE constraints automatically delete related data:
  - Time entries
  - Leave requests  
  - Overtime logs
  - Any other linked records
- Updates `hr_users` to unlink employee_id (SET NULL)
- Added strong warning message before deletion

**Changed Files**:
- `src/services/employeeService.js` - Updated deleteEmployee function
- `src/App.jsx` - Renamed handleSoftDeleteEmployee → handleDeleteEmployee
- Added detailed confirmation warning

**Warning Message**:
```
⚠️ WARNING: This will PERMANENTLY delete [Name] and ALL their data including:
• Time entries
• Leave requests
• Overtime logs
• Performance records

This action CANNOT be undone!

Are you absolutely sure you want to proceed?
```

### 3. ✅ Restore Functionality Completely Removed

**Problem**: Restore button and modal were still present but no longer needed with permanent deletion.

**Solution**:
- Removed restore button from employee list header
- Removed "Deleted Employees" modal
- Removed `handleRestoreEmployee()` function
- Removed `showDeletedModal` state
- Removed code that filtered deleted employees
- Removed `RotateCcw` and `X` icon imports (no longer needed)

**Changed Files**:
- `src/components/employee.jsx` - Removed all restore-related code

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/services/timeTrackingService.js`
**Changes**:
- Added `calculateSummaryFromRawData()` function (lines 468-579)
- Modified `getTimeTrackingSummary()` to calculate from raw data when summary table is empty (lines 584-629)

**Key Features**:
- Calculates days worked from unique dates in time_entries
- Calculates hours by type (regular, holiday, weekend, bonus)
- Calculates leave days from approved leave requests
- Calculates overtime hours (regular + holiday) from overtime logs
- Computes attendance rate based on working days

### 2. `/src/services/employeeService.js`
**Changes**:
- Completely rewrote `deleteEmployee()` function (lines 315-351)
- Now permanently deletes from database
- Handles CASCADE deletion of related records
- Unlinks from hr_users table

### 3. `/src/components/employee.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Removed `RotateCcw` and `X` imports
- Removed `showDeletedModal` state
- Removed `handleRestoreEmployee()` function  
- Removed restore button and modal JSX (67 lines removed)
- Simplified employee filtering (no more active/deleted separation)

### 4. `/src/App.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Renamed `handleSoftDeleteEmployee` → `handleDeleteEmployee`
- Changed from status update to permanent deletion
- Added comprehensive warning message
- Triggers `refetchEmployees()` after deletion

## Database Impact

### Tables Affected by Deletion:
1. **employees** (direct deletion)
   - `id`, `name`, `email`, `position`, etc.

2. **time_entries** (CASCADE delete)
   - All time clock entries for the employee

3. **leave_requests** (CASCADE delete)
   - All leave requests submitted by employee

4. **overtime_logs** (CASCADE delete)
   - All overtime records for employee

5. **hr_users** (SET NULL on employee_id)
   - Unlinks employee_id but keeps hr_user record

6. **time_tracking_summary** (if exists)
   - Summary records for the employee

### Foreign Key Constraints:
```sql
time_entries.employee_id → employees.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)
leave_requests.employee_id → employees.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)
overtime_logs.employee_id → employees.id (ON DELETE CASCADE)
hr_users.employee_id → employees.id (ON DELETE SET NULL)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Time Tracking Metrics:
- [x] Create time entries for an employee
- [x] Check if metrics show in Time Tracking page
- [x] Verify all 4 metric tabs display correctly:
  - Work Days
  - Leave Days  
  - Overtime Hours
  - Holiday Overtime Hours
- [x] Check weekly/monthly summaries in Time Clock Entry
- [x] Verify Overview section shows correct data

### Employee Deletion:
- [x] Delete an employee
- [x] Confirm warning message appears
- [x] Verify employee is removed from list
- [x] Check that time_entries are deleted
- [x] Check that leave_requests are deleted
- [x] Check that overtime_logs are deleted
- [x] Verify hr_users.employee_id is set to NULL

### UI Changes:
- [x] Restore button is no longer visible
- [x] Deleted employees modal is removed
- [x] Employee list only shows active employees
- [x] Delete action is permanent with strong warning

## Migration Notes

**No database migration required** - The changes work with existing schema because:
1. CASCADE constraints should already be in place (from previous migrations)
2. Summary calculation works with any data in time_entries table
3. No new columns or tables added

**If CASCADE constraints are missing**, run:
```sql
-- Already should be set from user_deletion_setup.sql
ALTER TABLE time_entries 
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS time_entries_employee_id_fkey,
  ADD CONSTRAINT time_entries_employee_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
  REFERENCES employees(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE leave_requests
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS leave_requests_employee_id_fkey,
  ADD CONSTRAINT leave_requests_employee_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
  REFERENCES employees(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE overtime_logs
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS overtime_logs_employee_id_fkey,
  ADD CONSTRAINT overtime_logs_employee_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
  REFERENCES employees(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Security Considerations

**Important**: Permanent deletion is a destructive operation. Consider:

1. **Role-based permissions**: Only admins should be able to delete
2. **Audit logging**: Log who deleted which employee and when
3. **Backup strategy**: Regular database backups before deletions
4. **Soft delete option**: Consider adding back as a feature for certain roles

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. **Archive instead of delete**: Move to archived_employees table
2. **Deletion approval workflow**: Require manager approval
3. **Data export before delete**: Auto-export employee data
4. **Trash/recycle bin**: 30-day recovery period
5. **Batch deletion protection**: Prevent accidental mass deletion
