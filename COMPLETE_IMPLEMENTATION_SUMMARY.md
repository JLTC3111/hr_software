## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Dashboard Changes

#### State Management:
```javascript
const [allEmployeesData, setAllEmployeesData] = useState([]);
```

#### Data Fetching:
- Fetches `regular_hours`, `overtime_hours`, `holiday_overtime_hours` for each employee
- Stores in `allEmployeesData` array for chart rendering
- Aggregates totals for metric cards

#### Overtime Calculation:
```javascript
// In metric cards
const totalOvertime = trackingDataValues.reduce((sum, emp) => 
  sum + (emp?.overtime || 0) + (emp?.holidayOvertime || 0), 0
).toFixed(1);

// In charts
overtimeHours: ((item.data?.overtime_hours || 0) + 
                (item.data?.holiday_overtime_hours || 0)).toFixed(1)
```

### Time Clock Entry Changes

#### State Management:
```javascript
const [leaveRequests, setLeaveRequests] = useState([]);
const [showLeaveModal, setShowLeaveModal] = useState(false);
const [leaveForm, setLeaveForm] = useState({
  type: 'vacation',
  startDate: '',
  endDate: '',
  reason: ''
});
```

#### Data Fetching:
```javascript
// Fetches both time entries AND leave requests
const leaveResult = await timeTrackingService.getLeaveRequests(employeeId, {
  year: new Date().getFullYear()
});
```

#### Leave Request Submission:
```javascript
const result = await timeTrackingService.createLeaveRequest({
  employeeId: employeeId,
  type: leaveForm.type,
  startDate: leaveForm.startDate,
  endDate: leaveForm.endDate,
  reason: leaveForm.reason
});
```

## üìä Database Integration

### Tables Used:

1. **time_tracking_summary**
   - Contains: `regular_hours`, `overtime_hours`, `holiday_overtime_hours`, `total_hours`
   - Used by: Dashboard charts and metrics
   - Status filter: Counts `pending` + `approved` (excludes `rejected`)

2. **leave_requests**
   - Fields: `employee_id`, `leave_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `days_count`, `status`, `reason`
   - Created by: Time Clock Entry leave request form
   - Status filter: Counts `pending` + `approved` in metrics

3. **time_entries**
   - Used for: Hour tracking
   - Status filter: Counts `pending` + `approved` in metrics

### Database Function:
The existing `fix_summary_complete_final.sql` migration ensures all hour types are properly counted and aggregated.
