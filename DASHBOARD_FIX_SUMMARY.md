# Dashboard Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Browser Extension Error ❌ (Not from your code)
**Error:** `Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.`

**Source:** This error comes from `content-all.js`, which is a browser extension file (not your application code).

**Cause:** Browser extensions (like Chrome extensions) sometimes try to communicate with content scripts that have been removed or are no longer available.

**Solution:** 
- This is NOT a bug in your dashboard code
- You can safely ignore this error OR
- Disable browser extensions temporarily to prevent it
- It won't affect your application's functionality

### 2. Employee ID Type Migration ✅ (Fixed)
**Issue:** Database schema migrated from INTEGER to TEXT for employee_id, but dashboard.jsx had inconsistent ID handling.

**Changes Made:**
All employee ID references in `dashboard.jsx` now consistently use `String(emp.id)` to ensure compatibility with TEXT type:

1. **Line 30:** API calls to `getTimeTrackingSummary()` 
   - Changed from: `emp.id.toString()`
   - Changed to: `String(emp.id)`

2. **Lines 40, 50:** Building `trackingData` object
   - Now uses: `const empId = String(emp.id)`
   - Ensures all object keys are strings

3. **Lines 95-96:** Performance chart data
   - Now uses: `timeTrackingData[String(emp.id)]`

4. **Lines 113-114:** Leave data chart
   - Now uses: `timeTrackingData[String(emp.id)]`

5. **Lines 124-125:** Top performers calculation
   - Now uses: `timeTrackingData[String(emp.id)]`

## Database Schema Alignment

Your dashboard is now fully compatible with the TEXT employee_id schema:

```sql
-- Your database schema (from migration 003)
employee_id TEXT NOT NULL
```

```javascript
// Your dashboard now consistently uses
String(emp.id) // Ensures TEXT compatibility
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload the application
2. **Test employee data loading** to ensure all charts populate correctly
3. **Verify time tracking data** displays properly for all employees
4. **Check console** for any remaining errors (ignore the browser extension error)

## Next Steps

✅ Dashboard is now using TEXT employee IDs consistently
✅ All API calls properly convert IDs to strings
✅ Data lookups use string keys for compatibility

Your dashboard should now work correctly with the migrated database schema!
