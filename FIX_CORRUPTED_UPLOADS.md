# Fix for Corrupted PDF Uploads - Multipart Boundary Issue

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The PDF files in Supabase storage are corrupted! They contain the entire HTTP multipart form data (including boundaries and headers) instead of just the PDF binary.

**Evidence from your screenshots**:
```
------WebKitFormBoundaryTiVnw7Dnnlqfqzg4
Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""; filename="Hồ_sơ_Đinh_Tùng_Dương.pdf"
Content-Type: application/pdf

%PDF-1.3  ← Actual PDF starts here, but wrapped in form data
```

This is why both iframe and direct URL show gibberish - the files themselves are corrupted, not a display issue!

## ✅ FIX APPLIED

### Code Change: Read File as ArrayBuffer

**Problem**: Passing File object directly to Supabase caused multipart boundaries to be included

**Solution**: Read file as ArrayBuffer and convert to clean Blob before upload

**New Upload Code**:
```javascript
// Read file as ArrayBuffer (pure binary)
const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();

// Create clean Blob with correct MIME type
const blob = new Blob([arrayBuffer], { type: 'application/pdf' });

// Upload the blob
await supabase.storage.upload(filePath, blob, {
  contentType: 'application/pdf',
  cacheControl: '3600',
  upsert: false
});
```

**Why This Works**:
- ArrayBuffer contains pure binary data
- Blob recreates the file without any HTTP metadata
- Supabase uploads clean PDF binary only

## 🗑️ CLEAN UP REQUIRED

### Step 1: Delete ALL Existing PDFs

All PDFs currently in `employee-documents` bucket are corrupted and cannot be fixed.

**In Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to Storage > employee-documents
2. Select ALL PDF files
3. Click Delete
4. Confirm deletion

**Why**: Corrupted files cannot be repaired. Must be re-uploaded with fixed code.

---

### Step 2: Clear Database References

**Run this SQL**:
```sql
-- Optional: Clear PDF references from employees table
-- This prevents showing errors for non-existent files
UPDATE employees
SET pdf_document_url = NULL
WHERE pdf_document_url IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify
SELECT id, name, pdf_document_url
FROM employees
WHERE pdf_document_url IS NOT NULL;
-- Should return 0 rows
```

---

### Step 3: Test New Upload

1. **Open employee modal** in your app
2. **Go to Documents tab** (Tài liệu)
3. **Upload a PDF**
4. **Watch browser console** for these messages:
   ```
   📁 File selected: filename.pdf Type: application/pdf Size: 123456
   📖 Reading file as ArrayBuffer...
   📤 Uploading blob: 123456 bytes, type: application/pdf
   ✅ Upload successful
   ✅ URL accessible, Content-Type: application/pdf
   ✅ Iframe loaded successfully
   ```

5. **Verify in Supabase**:
   - Go to Storage > employee-documents
   - Click on the uploaded file
   - Should show: Content-Type: application/pdf
   - Click the public URL - should display PDF in browser

6. **Verify in App**:
   - PDF should display correctly in iframe
   - No gibberish characters
   - Clean PDF rendering

---

## 🧪 Test Direct URL

After uploading with the fix, test the URL directly:

1. Copy PDF URL from Supabase
2. Open in new browser tab
3. **Expected**: PDF displays in browser
4. **NOT**: Gibberish text with multipart boundaries

---

## 📊 How to Verify Fix

### Before Fix (Corrupted):
```
Opening URL shows:
------WebKitFormBoundary...
Content-Disposition: form-data...
Content-Type: application/pdf
%PDF-1.3
...gibberish...
```

### After Fix (Correct):
```
Opening URL shows:
Clean PDF rendering in browser
OR
Browser's native PDF viewer opens
OR
PDF downloads with correct icon/type
```

### Console Before Fix:
```
(No logs, or generic errors)
```

### Console After Fix:
```
📁 File selected: test.pdf Type: application/pdf Size: 50000
📖 Reading file as ArrayBuffer...
📤 Uploading blob: 50000 bytes, type: application/pdf
✅ Upload successful: {path: "..."}
✅ Database updated with path: ...
📎 Public URL: https://...
✅ URL accessible, Content-Type: application/pdf
✅ Iframe loaded successfully
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Multipart Boundaries Were Saved

**Hypothesis 1**: Supabase SDK Issue
- Some versions of @supabase/storage-js may incorrectly serialize File objects
- Possible fix: Upgrade @supabase/supabase-js to latest version

**Hypothesis 2**: Browser File API Issue
- File object may have been passed with metadata attached
- Solution: Convert to ArrayBuffer first (now implemented)

**Hypothesis 3**: Proxy/Middleware Interference
- Unlikely given Supabase direct connection
- But worth checking if using any proxies

**Most Likely**: File object serialization issue in Supabase SDK

**Solution**: Read as ArrayBuffer and create clean Blob (now implemented ✅)

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

After applying fix and re-uploading:

- [ ] All old corrupted PDFs deleted from Supabase
- [ ] Database pdf_document_url cleared (optional)
- [ ] New PDF uploaded via app
- [ ] Console shows clean upload process (📁📖📤✅)
- [ ] Direct URL test: PDF displays correctly
- [ ] Iframe in app: PDF displays correctly
- [ ] No gibberish or multipart boundaries visible
- [ ] Content-Type header: application/pdf
- [ ] File size matches original PDF size

## 🚨 If Still Showing Gibberish

If after fixing and re-uploading you STILL see gibberish:

### Check 1: Browser Cache
```javascript
// Clear browser cache
// Or open in Incognito/Private mode
```

### Check 2: Supabase Version
```bash
# Check package.json
npm list @supabase/supabase-js

# Update to latest
npm update @supabase/supabase-js
```

### Check 3: File Input Element
```javascript
// Make sure input accepts PDF
<input type="file" accept="application/pdf" />
```

### Check 4: Test with Simple PDF
- Create a simple 1-page PDF
- Upload via app
- If this works, original PDF may be corrupted

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **src/components/employeeDetailModal.jsx**
   - Lines 151-156: Added ArrayBuffer conversion
   - Added comprehensive console logging
   - Ensures clean binary upload

## 💡 Technical Explanation

### File Upload Process

**Before (Incorrect)**:
```javascript
File Object → Supabase Upload → Corrupted (includes HTTP metadata)
```

**After (Correct)**:
```javascript
File Object → .arrayBuffer() → Clean Binary Data
Clean Binary → new Blob() → Pure PDF binary
Pure PDF → Supabase Upload → Perfect Upload ✅
```

### Why ArrayBuffer Works

- **File.arrayBuffer()**: Extracts raw binary data, discards all metadata
- **new Blob()**: Creates fresh binary object with only specified MIME type
- **Result**: Pure PDF binary with no HTTP artifacts

---

## ✅ Summary

**Problem**: PDF files saved with multipart form boundaries  
**Cause**: File object uploaded with HTTP metadata  
**Solution**: Convert to ArrayBuffer → Blob before upload  
**Action Required**: Delete all existing PDFs and re-upload  
**Status**: Fix applied, ready for testing

**Delete all existing PDFs from Supabase and re-upload with the fixed code!** 🎯
