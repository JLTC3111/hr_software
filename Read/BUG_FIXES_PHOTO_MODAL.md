# üîß Bug Fixes - Employee Photo Upload & Modal Errors

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå `fetchEmployees is not defined`
**Error Location:** `App.jsx:609`
**Root Cause:** `fetchEmployees` was declared inside `useEffect` scope, making it inaccessible from other functions

**Solution:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Function scoped inside useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchEmployees = async () => { ... }
  fetchEmployees();
}, []);

// AFTER: Function declared at component level
const fetchEmployees = async () => { ... };

useEffect(() => {
  fetchEmployees();
}, []);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx` (lines 160-192)

---

### 2. ‚ùå `setSelectedEmployee is not defined`
**Error Location:** `App.jsx:439`
**Root Cause:** `setSelectedEmployee` was being called in `onUpdate` callback but wasn't passed to `AppContent`

**Solution:**
Simplified the `onUpdate` callback to only refetch employees without trying to update selected employee state:

```javascript
// BEFORE:
onUpdate={async (updatedEmployee) => {
  await refetchEmployees();
  setSelectedEmployee(updatedEmployee); // ‚ùå Not in scope
}}

// AFTER:
onUpdate={async (updatedEmployee) => {
  await refetchEmployees(); // ‚úÖ Just refetch and let modal close
}}
```

**Why this works:**
- Modal closes after update (`onClose` is called after save)
- When modal closes, `selectedEmployee` becomes `null` (via `handleCloseModal`)
- Employee list is refreshed with latest data from database
- No need to manually update selected employee state

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx` (lines 432-440)

### 3. ‚ùå Storage path 400 error: `employee-photos/employee-photos/...`
**Error:** `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400`
**Error URL:** `...employee-photos/employee-photos/16_1761213400302.jpeg`
**Root Cause:** Duplicate bucket name in file path

**Solution:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Path included bucket name
const filePath = `employee-photos/${fileName}`; // ‚ùå Duplicate
await supabase.storage.from('employee-photos').upload(filePath, file);
// Result: employee-photos/employee-photos/16_xxx.jpeg

// AFTER: Path is just the filename
const filePath = `${fileName}`; // ‚úÖ Correct
await supabase.storage.from('employee-photos').upload(filePath, file);
// Result: employee-photos/16_xxx.jpeg
```

**Explanation:**
- `.from('employee-photos')` already sets the bucket
- `filePath` parameter is the path **within** the bucket
- Including bucket name again creates duplicate path

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/employeeService.js` (line 247)
- `src/services/employeeService.js` (line 308) - also fixed `deleteEmployeePhoto`

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Test Employee Photo Upload
1. Click on an employee card
2. Click camera icon to upload photo
3. Select an image file
4. Verify upload succeeds
5. Check browser console - no 400 errors
6. Verify photo displays correctly
7. Check Supabase Storage - file path should be: `16_1234567890.jpeg` (not `employee-photos/16_...`)

### ‚úÖ Test Employee Edit & Save
1. Click Edit button on employee card
2. Modal opens in edit mode
3. Modify employee details (name, email, position, etc.)
4. Click Save
5. Verify no console errors
6. Modal closes automatically
7. Employee list refreshes with updated data
8. Click on employee again - verify changes persisted

### ‚úÖ Test Employee View
1. Click eye icon on employee card
2. Modal opens in view mode
3. All data displays correctly
4. Close modal
5. No errors in console

## Additional Improvements Made

### Fixed `deleteEmployeePhoto` function
**Issue:** Was using wrong bucket name (`hr-documents` instead of `employee-photos`)

```javascript
// BEFORE:
const { error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('hr-documents') // ‚ùå Wrong bucket
  .remove([filePath]);

// AFTER:
const { error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('employee-photos') // ‚úÖ Correct bucket
  .remove([fileName]);
```

## Summary

| Issue | Status | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `fetchEmployees` not defined | ‚úÖ Fixed | Can now be called from anywhere in HRManagementApp |
| `setSelectedEmployee` not defined | ‚úÖ Fixed | Modal update works without errors |
| Duplicate storage path (400 error) | ‚úÖ Fixed | Photos upload successfully to correct path |
| Wrong bucket in delete function | ‚úÖ Fixed | Photo deletion will work correctly |

**All errors resolved!** ‚úÖ

The application should now work smoothly with:
- ‚úÖ Photo uploads to correct Supabase Storage path
- ‚úÖ Employee edits saving properly
- ‚úÖ Modal state management working correctly
- ‚úÖ No console errors

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to implement the production-ready photo storage from earlier recommendations:

1. **Run migration:** `010_employee_photos_table.sql`
2. **Create storage bucket** with folder structure (originals/, thumbnails/, archives/)
3. **Use enhanced photo service** for optimization and thumbnails
4. **Add photo history UI** to view version history

See `PHOTO_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for complete guide.
