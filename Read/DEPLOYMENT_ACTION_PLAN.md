# 🚀 Foreign Key Fix - Deployment Action Plan

## ⚡ Quick Reference

**Problem:** Foreign key constraint violations when creating time entries  
**Solution:** 3-part fix (validation + auto-creation + CASCADE constraints)  
**Time to Deploy:** ~15 minutes  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 Low (backwards compatible)

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (5 min)

- [ ] **Backup Database**
  ```bash
  # In Supabase Dashboard → Database → Backups
  # Create manual backup before proceeding
  ```

- [ ] **Review Changes**
  - [ ] Read `FOREIGN_KEY_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
  - [ ] Review code changes in `timeTrackingService.js`
  - [ ] Review code changes in `timeClockEntry.jsx`

- [ ] **Check Current State**
  ```sql
  -- Check for existing orphaned records
  SELECT 
    te.id, te.employee_id, te.date
  FROM time_entries te
  LEFT JOIN employees e ON te.employee_id = e.id
  WHERE e.id IS NULL
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

---

### Phase 2: Database Migration (5 min)

- [ ] **Run Migration**
  
  **Option A: Supabase SQL Editor** (Recommended)
  ```sql
  -- Copy entire content from:
  -- supabase/migrations/004_improve_foreign_key_constraints.sql
  -- Paste in SQL Editor and run
  ```

  **Option B: Supabase CLI**
  ```bash
  cd /Users/skycastle3/Desktop/ICUE_company_software/hr_software
  supabase db push
  ```

- [ ] **Verify Migration**
  ```sql
  -- Should return CASCADE and SET NULL actions
  SELECT 
    conname,
    conrelid::regclass AS table_name,
    CASE confdeltype
      WHEN 'c' THEN 'CASCADE'
      WHEN 'n' THEN 'SET NULL'
      ELSE 'OTHER'
    END AS on_delete_action
  FROM pg_constraint
  WHERE conname LIKE '%employee_id_fkey%'
    OR conname LIKE '%approved_by_fkey%';
  ```

- [ ] **Check Helper Functions**
  ```sql
  -- Should return function definitions
  SELECT routine_name 
  FROM information_schema.routines
  WHERE routine_name IN ('check_orphaned_time_entries', 'clean_orphaned_records');
  ```

---

### Phase 3: Clean Up Data (2 min)

- [ ] **Find Orphaned Records**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();
  ```

- [ ] **Clean If Needed** (Only if orphaned records found)
  ```sql
  -- ⚠️ WARNING: This deletes data permanently
  -- Review orphaned records first before cleaning
  SELECT * FROM clean_orphaned_records();
  ```

---

### Phase 4: Code Deployment (Already Done ✅)

Code changes are already in place:
- ✅ `src/services/timeTrackingService.js` - Updated with validation
- ✅ `src/components/timeClockEntry.jsx` - Updated with employee check
- No additional code deployment needed

---

### Phase 5: Testing (3 min)

- [ ] **Test 1: Existing Employee Time Entry**
  - Login as existing employee
  - Go to Time Clock Entry
  - Submit a time entry
  - ✅ Should succeed

- [ ] **Test 2: New User Time Entry**
  - Create new auth user (or use test account)
  - Login with new user
  - Submit time entry
  - ✅ Should auto-create employee and succeed

- [ ] **Test 3: Verify Employee Auto-Creation**
  ```sql
  -- Check if new employee was created
  SELECT id, name, email, created_at 
  FROM employees 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

- [ ] **Test 4: Delete Employee (Dev Only)**
  ```sql
  -- In DEV environment only!
  -- Create test employee
  INSERT INTO employees (name, email, department, position, status)
  VALUES ('Test User', 'test@test.com', 'IT', 'Tester', 'Active')
  RETURNING id;
  
  -- Create test time entry for them
  -- Then try deleting employee
  DELETE FROM employees WHERE email = 'test@test.com';
  -- ✅ Should delete employee and cascade to time_entries
  ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: Migration Fails

**Symptoms:** SQL error during migration  
**Solutions:**
1. Check if constraints already exist with different names
2. Drop existing constraints manually first:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE time_entries DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS time_entries_employee_id_fkey CASCADE;
   ```
3. Re-run migration

---

### Issue 2: Still Getting FK Errors

**Symptoms:** Foreign key errors after migration  
**Solutions:**
1. Verify migration ran successfully
2. Check if employee exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = [problematic_id];
   ```
3. Check application is using updated code
4. Clear browser cache/restart app

---

### Issue 3: Orphaned Records Found

**Symptoms:** `check_orphaned_time_entries()` returns results  
**Solutions:**
1. Review orphaned records carefully
2. Decide: clean or create missing employees?
3. To create missing employees:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email, department, position, status)
   SELECT DISTINCT 
     te.employee_id,
     'Unknown Employee ' || te.employee_id,
     'employee' || te.employee_id || '@company.com',
     'General',
     'Employee',
     'Inactive'
   FROM time_entries te
   LEFT JOIN employees e ON te.employee_id = e.id
   WHERE e.id IS NULL;
   ```
4. Or to clean:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM clean_orphaned_records();
   ```

---

### Issue 4: Can't Delete Employee

**Symptoms:** FK constraint error when deleting  
**Solutions:**
1. Verify migration applied CASCADE:
   ```sql
   SELECT confdeltype FROM pg_constraint 
   WHERE conname = 'time_entries_employee_id_fkey';
   -- Should return 'c' for CASCADE
   ```
2. If not 'c', re-run migration
3. Check RLS policies aren't blocking

---

## 📊 Monitoring Post-Deployment

### Week 1: Daily Checks
```sql
-- Check for FK errors in logs
SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();

-- Monitor employee creation
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as new_employees
FROM employees
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Monitor time entry creation
SELECT 
  DATE(submitted_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as entries,
  COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) as unique_employees
FROM time_entries
WHERE submitted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(submitted_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Ongoing: Weekly Checks
```sql
-- Orphaned records check
SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();

-- Employee statistics
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM employees
GROUP BY status;

-- Time entry statistics
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM time_entries
WHERE date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY status;
```
