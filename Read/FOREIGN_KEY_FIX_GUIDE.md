# Foreign Key Constraint Fix Guide

## Problem Summary
**Error:** `insert or update on table "time_entries" violates foreign key constraint "time_entries_employee_id_fkey"`

This error occurs when trying to create a time entry for an employee ID that doesn't exist in the `employees` table.

---

## üéØ Solutions Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Employee Validation Before Insert
**File:** `/src/services/timeTrackingService.js`

All create functions now validate employee existence:
- `createTimeEntry()` - Validates employee before creating time entry
- `createLeaveRequest()` - Validates employee before creating leave request
- `createOvertimeLog()` - Validates employee before creating overtime log

**What it does:**
- Checks if employee exists in database
- Returns user-friendly error messages if employee not found
- Prevents foreign key constraint violations

**Example Error Messages:**
```
"Employee with ID 123 does not exist. Please make sure the employee is registered in the system before creating time entries."

"Employee not found. Please ensure the employee exists before creating time entries."
```

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Auto-Create Employee Records
**File:** `/src/services/timeTrackingService.js`

Two new helper functions:

#### `ensureEmployeeExists(employeeId, employeeData)`
- Checks if employee exists
- Creates employee if not exists (when data provided)
- Returns employee record

**Usage:**
```javascript
const result = await timeTrackingService.ensureEmployeeExists(userId, {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@company.com',
  position: 'Developer',
  department: 'Engineering'
});

if (result.success) {
  if (result.created) {
    console.log('Employee created:', result.data);
  } else {
    console.log('Employee exists:', result.data);
  }
}
```

#### `getOrCreateEmployeeFromAuth(authUser)`
- Specifically for Supabase auth users
- Automatically extracts user data from auth object
- Creates employee record if needed

**Usage:**
```javascript
const result = await timeTrackingService.getOrCreateEmployeeFromAuth(user);
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Time Clock Entry Component Updated
**File:** `/src/components/timeClockEntry.jsx`

Now checks employee existence before submitting:
```javascript
// Ensure employee exists in database before creating time entry
const employeeCheck = await timeTrackingService.ensureEmployeeExists(user?.id, {
  name: user?.user_metadata?.name || user?.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User',
  email: user?.email,
  position: user?.user_metadata?.position,
  department: user?.user_metadata?.department
});

if (!employeeCheck.success) {
  setErrors({ general: employeeCheck.error });
  return;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Auto-creates employee record for logged-in users
- Prevents foreign key errors
- Seamless user experience

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Database Foreign Key Constraints Improved
**File:** `/supabase/migrations/004_improve_foreign_key_constraints.sql`

#### ON DELETE CASCADE
When an employee is deleted, automatically delete all related records:
- ‚úÖ Time entries
- ‚úÖ Leave requests
- ‚úÖ Overtime logs
- ‚úÖ Time tracking summaries

```sql
ALTER TABLE time_entries 
  ADD CONSTRAINT time_entries_employee_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
  REFERENCES employees(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

#### ON DELETE SET NULL
When an approver is deleted, preserve records but clear approver reference:
- ‚úÖ Time entry approvals
- ‚úÖ Leave request approvals
- ‚úÖ Overtime log approvals

```sql
ALTER TABLE time_entries 
  ADD CONSTRAINT time_entries_approved_by_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (approved_by) 
  REFERENCES employees(id) 
  ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
supabase/migrations/004_improve_foreign_key_constraints.sql
```

Or if using Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Code Changes
All code changes are already in place:
- ‚úÖ timeTrackingService.js updated
- ‚úÖ timeClockEntry.jsx updated
- No additional code changes needed

### Step 3: Check for Orphaned Records (Optional)
```sql
-- Check if any orphaned records exist
SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();

-- If found, clean them up
SELECT * FROM clean_orphaned_records();
```

---

## üîç Database Helper Functions

### Check for Orphaned Records
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();
```

**Returns:**
- `table_name` - Which table has orphaned records
- `record_id` - ID of the orphaned record
- `employee_id` - The missing employee ID
- `message` - Description of the issue

### Clean Orphaned Records
```sql
SELECT * FROM clean_orphaned_records();
```

**Returns:**
- `table_name` - Which table was cleaned
- `records_deleted` - How many records were removed

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This permanently deletes orphaned records. Use with caution!

## üìä Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Create Time Entry with Existing Employee
```javascript
// Should work - employee exists
const result = await timeTrackingService.createTimeEntry({
  employeeId: 1, // existing employee
  date: '2025-01-15',
  clockIn: '09:00',
  clockOut: '17:00',
  hours: 8,
  hourType: 'regular'
});
// Result: success: true
```

### Test 2: Create Time Entry with Non-Existent Employee
```javascript
// Should fail gracefully with clear error message
const result = await timeTrackingService.createTimeEntry({
  employeeId: 99999, // doesn't exist
  date: '2025-01-15',
  clockIn: '09:00',
  clockOut: '17:00',
  hours: 8,
  hourType: 'regular'
});
// Result: success: false, error: "Employee with ID 99999 does not exist..."
```

### Test 3: Auto-Create Employee from Auth User
```javascript
// Should auto-create employee if not exists
const employeeCheck = await timeTrackingService.ensureEmployeeExists(authUser.id, {
  name: authUser.email.split('@')[0],
  email: authUser.email
});
// Result: success: true, created: true (if new)
```

### Test 4: Delete Employee with CASCADE
```sql
-- Delete employee - should auto-delete all related records
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
-- All time_entries, leave_requests, overtime_logs for employee 1 are deleted
```

---

## üéì Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always validate employee existence** before creating related records
2. **Use `ensureEmployeeExists()`** when you want auto-creation
3. **Use validation in `createTimeEntry()`** when you want strict checking
4. **Handle errors gracefully** and show user-friendly messages

### For Database Administrators

1. **Run migration** to ensure CASCADE behavior
2. **Check for orphaned records** periodically
3. **Use indexes** (already created in migration) for performance
4. **Monitor foreign key violations** in logs

### For HR/Admins

1. **Register employees** before they create time entries
2. **Don't delete employees** that have historical records (use status='Inactive' instead)
3. **If deletion is necessary**, be aware all related records will be deleted

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Employee with ID X does not exist"
**Solution:** 
- Check if employee exists: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = X;`
- If not, create employee or use `ensureEmployeeExists()`

### Error: "Failed to validate employee"
**Solution:**
- Check database connection
- Verify RLS policies allow reading from employees table
- Check user permissions

### Orphaned Records After Migration
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Find orphaned records
SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();

-- Clean them up
SELECT * FROM clean_orphaned_records();
```

### Performance Issues
**Solution:**
- Indexes already created in migration
- If still slow, run: `ANALYZE employees, time_entries, leave_requests, overtime_logs;`

## üìù Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backup database before migration
- [ ] Run `004_improve_foreign_key_constraints.sql`
- [ ] Verify constraints: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_constraints WHERE table_name IN ('time_entries', 'leave_requests', 'overtime_logs');`
- [ ] Check for orphaned records: `SELECT * FROM check_orphaned_time_entries();`
- [ ] Clean orphaned records if any: `SELECT * FROM clean_orphaned_records();`
- [ ] Test time entry creation in UI
- [ ] Verify auto-employee creation works
- [ ] Test employee deletion (in dev environment)
- [ ] Monitor logs for foreign key errors

## üéâ Expected Behavior After Fix

### ‚úÖ Before Creating Time Entries:
- System checks if employee exists
- If not, auto-creates employee from auth user data
- User sees seamless experience

### ‚úÖ When Creating Time Entries:
- Validation happens before insert
