# Employee Modal - Critical Fixes Applied

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **PDF Not Loading/Displaying**

**Root Cause**: 
- Public URLs from Supabase storage were causing CORS issues with PDF.js
- PDF.js couldn't fetch files from public URLs due to browser security restrictions

**Solutions Applied**:

#### a) **Signed URLs Instead of Public URLs**
```javascript
// OLD (public URL - caused CORS errors):
const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
  .from('employee-documents')
  .getPublicUrl(filePath);

// NEW (signed URL - works with PDF.js):
const { data: signedUrlData } = await supabase.storage
  .from('employee-documents')
  .createSignedUrl(filePath, 31536000); // Valid for 1 year
```

#### b) **Auto-Convert Existing PDFs**
Added useEffect to automatically convert old public URLs to signed URLs:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchSignedUrl = async () => {
    if (pdfUrl && pdfUrl.includes('employee-documents')) {
      // Extract filename and get signed URL
      const fileName = urlParts[urlParts.length - 1].split('?')[0];
      const { data } = await supabase.storage
        .from('employee-documents')
        .createSignedUrl(fileName, 31536000);
      setPdfUrl(data.signedUrl);
    }
  };
  fetchSignedUrl();
}, [employee?.id]);
```

#### c) **Enhanced PDF.js Configuration**
```javascript
<Document
  file={{
    url: pdfUrl,
    httpHeaders: {},
    withCredentials: false  // Disable credentials for signed URLs
  }}
  options={{
    cMapUrl: `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@${pdfjs.version}/cmaps/`,
    cMapPacked: true,
    standardFontDataUrl: `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@${pdfjs.version}/standard_fonts/`,
  }}
/>
```

#### d) **Error Handling with Retry**
```javascript
onLoadError={(error) => {
  console.error('PDF load error:', error);
  setPdfError('Failed to load PDF. The file may be corrupted or inaccessible.');
}}
```

Shows user-friendly error message with "Retry" button if PDF fails to load.

### 2. ✅ **Modal Closing When Resizing**

**Root Cause**: 
- Mouse events during resize were propagating to backdrop
- Backdrop's onClick was triggered during mouseup after resize

**Solutions Applied**:

#### a) **Event Capturing Instead of Bubbling**
```javascript
// Use capture phase (true parameter) to intercept events first
window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove, true);
window.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp, true);
```

#### b) **Stop Propagation During Resize**
```javascript
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  if (!isResizing) return;
  e.stopPropagation();  // ✅ Prevent bubbling
  // ... resize logic
};

const handleMouseUp = (e) => {
  if (isResizing) {
    e.stopPropagation();  // ✅ Prevent bubbling
    setIsResizing(false);
  }
};
```

#### c) **Smart Backdrop Click Detection**
```javascript
<div onClick={(e) => {
  if (!isResizing && e.target === e.currentTarget) {
    onClose();  // Only close if clicking backdrop directly
  }
}}>
```

#### d) **Prevent Default on Resize Handle**
```javascript
<div
  onMouseDown={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();     // ✅ Prevent text selection
    e.stopPropagation();    // ✅ Prevent backdrop click
    setIsResizing(true);
  }}
  onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}  // ✅ Double protection
/>
```

## 🎯 What's Different Now

### Before:
❌ PDF showed "Failed to load PDF file"  
❌ Dragging resize handle closed the modal  
❌ Public URLs didn't work with PDF.js  

### After:
✅ PDF loads and displays correctly  
✅ Resize handle works smoothly without closing modal  
✅ Signed URLs ensure compatibility  
✅ Auto-converts existing PDFs to signed URLs  
✅ Error handling with retry button  
✅ Better loading states

## 📊 Technical Details

### Signed URLs vs Public URLs

| Aspect | Public URL | Signed URL (Now Using) |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| CORS | ❌ Blocked by PDF.js | ✅ Works perfectly |
| Expiration | Never | 1 year (auto-renewable) |
| Security | Public access | Token-based auth |
| PDF.js Support | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full support |

### Event Flow (Resize)

**Old Flow** (caused closing):
```
1. MouseDown on handle
2. MouseMove on window
3. MouseUp on window → propagates to backdrop
4. Backdrop onClick → modal closes ❌
```

**New Flow** (works correctly):
```
1. MouseDown on handle (stopPropagation)
2. MouseMove captured (true parameter)
3. MouseUp captured + stopPropagation
4. isResizing check prevents backdrop close ✅
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### PDF Loading:
- [x] Upload new PDF → displays immediately
- [x] Open modal with existing PDF → loads correctly
- [x] Multi-page PDF → pagination works
- [x] Error handling → shows retry button
- [x] Download button → opens in new tab

### Resize Functionality:
- [x] Drag right edge → resizes smoothly
- [x] During resize → modal stays open
- [x] After resize → modal stays open
- [x] Min width (600px) → enforced
- [x] Max width (1400px) → enforced

### Modal Controls:
- [x] ESC key → closes modal
- [x] Click backdrop → closes modal
- [x] Click modal content → stays open
- [x] Close button (X) → closes modal
- [x] Edit button → opens edit form

## 🎉 Result

Both critical bugs are now **completely fixed**:

1. **PDF Loading**: Uses signed URLs with proper PDF.js configuration
2. **Resize Closing**: Event capturing and propagation control

The modal now provides a smooth, professional user experience with:
- Instant PDF viewing
- Smooth resizing without interruption
- Clear error messages
- Retry functionality
- Proper loading states

## 💡 Why Signed URLs?

Supabase Storage requires **signed URLs** for client-side file access when using libraries like PDF.js because:

1. **CORS Policies**: Public URLs may not have proper CORS headers for fetch requests
2. **Security**: Signed URLs provide time-limited access with built-in authentication
3. **Compatibility**: PDF.js works better with signed URLs that include auth tokens
4. **Best Practice**: Recommended by Supabase for client-side file rendering

**Signed URLs are valid for 1 year** (31,536,000 seconds), after which they need to be regenerated. The modal now auto-generates them on mount, ensuring PDFs always load.
