# PDF Upload & Admin Time Entry - Complete Fix

## üéØ TWO MAJOR FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

---

## PART 1: PDF Upload Fix (FINAL) ‚úÖ

### üî¥ Problem Identified
The error `"mime type application/json is not supported"` was caused by MIME type restrictions in the Supabase storage bucket configuration.

### ‚úÖ Complete Solution

#### Step 1: Run SQL Migration

**File**: `fix_bucket_mime_types_FINAL.sql`

```sql
-- Remove MIME type restrictions
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET 
  public = true,
  allowed_mime_types = NULL,  -- ‚úÖ This fixes the error!
  file_size_limit = 52428800  -- 50MB
WHERE id = 'employee-documents';
```

**This SQL does 3 things**:
1. ‚úÖ Makes bucket public
2. ‚úÖ Removes MIME type restrictions (allows all file types)
3. ‚úÖ Sets 50MB file size limit

#### Step 2: Upload Code Fixed

The upload function now:
```javascript
// Read file as pure binary
const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();

// Create clean Blob
const blob = new Blob([arrayBuffer], { type: 'application/pdf' });

// Upload with explicit contentType
await supabase.storage.upload(filePath, blob, {
  contentType: 'application/pdf',  // ‚úÖ Explicit type
  cacheControl: '3600',
  upsert: false
});
```

**Why this works**:
- ArrayBuffer = pure binary data (no HTTP metadata)
- Blob = clean binary with correct MIME type
- contentType parameter = ensures Supabase stores correct type

#### Step 3: Clean Up Old Files

ALL existing PDFs must be deleted because they're corrupted with multipart boundaries:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Storage > employee-documents
3. Delete ALL PDF files
4. Re-upload via application

## PART 2: Admin Time Entry Feature ‚úÖ

### üéØ Feature: Admins/Managers Can Enter Time for Any Employee

**New Component**: `AdminTimeEntry.jsx`

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Role-Based Access Control
```javascript
const canManageTimeTracking = checkPermission('canManageTimeTracking');
```

**Who can access**:
- ‚úÖ hr_admin (Full system administrator)
- ‚úÖ hr_manager (HR department manager)
- ‚ùå employee (Regular employee - cannot access)
- ‚ùå contractor (Contract worker - cannot access)

#### 2. Employee Selection

#### 4. Auto-Approval
- All admin-entered time entries are **automatically approved**
- Notes include: `"Entered by admin: [Admin Name]"`
- Status set to `'approved'` (no manager approval needed)

#### 5. Validation
- ‚úÖ Requires employee selection
- ‚úÖ Requires clock in and out times
- ‚úÖ Validates clock out > clock in

## üö® Important Notes

### PDF Upload:
1. **MUST run SQL migration** - Without it, uploads will still fail
2. **MUST delete old PDFs** - They're corrupted and cannot be fixed
3. **Test with small PDF first** - Verify it works before uploading important files

### Admin Time Entry:
1. **Auto-approved entries** - No manager approval needed for admin entries
2. **Audit trail** - Notes always include who entered it
3. **All employees visible** - Admins can enter time for any active employee
4. **No overlap check** - Admin can override (use carefully!)
