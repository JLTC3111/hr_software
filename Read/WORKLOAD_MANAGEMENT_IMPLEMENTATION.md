## 📋 Next Steps (Backend Integration)

### 1. Create Database Tables:
```sql
-- tasks table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_id TEXT REFERENCES employees(id),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  due_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- task_assessments table
CREATE TABLE task_assessments (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id BIGINT REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  employee_id TEXT REFERENCES employees(id),
  self_assessment TEXT,
  quality_rating INTEGER CHECK (quality_rating >= 0 AND quality_rating <= 5),
  comments TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Create Service Functions:
Create `src/services/workloadService.js` with:
- `createTask()`
- `updateTask()`
- `deleteTask()`
- `getTasks(employeeId, filters)`
- `createAssessment()`
- `getAssessments(taskId)`

### 3. Update Component:
Replace localStorage with service calls in `workloadManagement.jsx`

### 4. Enable RLS:

ALTER TABLE task_assessments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
