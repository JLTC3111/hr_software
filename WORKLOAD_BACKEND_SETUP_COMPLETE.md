# Workload Management Backend Setup

## ✅ Files Created

1. **`WORKLOAD_TASKS_TABLE_SETUP.sql`** - Database schema
2. **`src/services/workloadService.js`** - Service layer
3. **Updated `src/components/workloadManagement.jsx`** - Component with backend integration

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Database Table

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `WORKLOAD_TASKS_TABLE_SETUP.sql`
3. Click "Run" to create the table and policies

### Step 2: Verify the Setup

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify the table was created:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.workload_tasks;
```

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. Navigate to Workload Management in the app
2. The component will now:
   - ✅ Load tasks from Supabase database
   - ✅ Save new tasks to database
   - ✅ Update tasks in real-time
   - ✅ Delete tasks from database
   - ✅ Subscribe to real-time changes

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Backend Integration
- ✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- ✅ Row-level security policies
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Loading states

### Service Layer Functions
- `getEmployeeTasks(employeeId)` - Get tasks for specific employee
- `getAllTasks(filters)` - Get all tasks with optional filters
- `getTaskById(taskId)` - Get single task details
- `createTask(taskData)` - Create new task
- `updateTask(taskId, updates)` - Update existing task
- `deleteTask(taskId)` - Delete task
- `getEmployeeTaskStats(employeeId)` - Get employee statistics
- `getOrganizationTaskStats()` - Get organization-wide statistics
- `subscribeToTaskChanges(employeeId, callback)` - Real-time updates

### UI Improvements
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Success/error messages
- Real-time updates (no page refresh needed)
- Database-backed persistence (no more localStorage)

## 📊 Database Schema

### Table: `workload_tasks`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | BIGSERIAL | Primary key |
| employee_id | INTEGER | Foreign key to employees |
| title | TEXT | Task title |
| description | TEXT | Task description |
| due_date | DATE | Due date |
| priority | TEXT | Priority: low, medium, high |
| status | TEXT | Status: pending, in-progress, completed, cancelled |
| self_assessment | TEXT | Employee's self-assessment |
| quality_rating | INTEGER | Quality rating (0-5) |
| comments | TEXT | Additional comments |
| created_by | INTEGER | Who created the task |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | Last update timestamp |

## 🔒 Security

Row-level security (RLS) is enabled with policies for:
- ✅ Authenticated users can view all tasks
- ✅ Authenticated users can create tasks
- ✅ Authenticated users can update tasks
- ✅ Authenticated users can delete tasks

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If tasks don't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the `workload_tasks` table exists in Supabase
3. Check RLS policies are enabled
4. Ensure user is authenticated

### If tasks don't save:
1. Check the `employee_id` is valid (exists in `employees` table)
2. Verify required fields are filled (title, due_date)
3. Check browser console for error messages

## 🎉 Migration Complete!

The Workload Management feature now uses proper backend support with Supabase. All data is persisted to the database and updates in real-time across all users.

**Previous**: localStorage (data lost on browser clear)
**Now**: Supabase database (persistent, real-time, secure)
