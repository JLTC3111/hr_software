-- ============================================================
-- Fix time_tracking_summary Foreign Key Constraint
-- ============================================================
-- This script adds CASCADE delete to time_tracking_summary
-- so that when an employee is deleted, their summary records
-- are also deleted automatically.
-- ============================================================

-- Drop existing constraint if it exists
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS time_tracking_summary 
  DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS time_tracking_summary_employee_id_fkey;

-- Add new constraint with CASCADE delete
ALTER TABLE time_tracking_summary
  ADD CONSTRAINT time_tracking_summary_employee_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) 
  REFERENCES employees(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Verify the constraint
